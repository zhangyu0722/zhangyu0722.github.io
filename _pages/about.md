About me
======
Hi! Iâ€™m a Ph.D. student majoring in computer science in the [School of Computer Science and Engineering](https://www2.scut.edu.cn/cs/) at [South China University of Technology](https://www.scut.edu.cn/new/). I am fortunately advised by Prof. Lu Lu. 

My research interests include inference acceleration for large language models (LLMs), GEMM optimization, and parallel computing acceleration techniques for AI. I focus on improving computational efficiency and scalability through hardware-aware optimization and parallel processing.

Publications
======
Like many other Jekyll-based GitHub Pages templates, Academic Pages makes you separate the website's content from its form. The content & metadata of your website are in structured markdown files, while various other files constitute the theme, specifying how to transform that content & metadata into HTML pages. You keep these various markdown (.md), YAML (.yml), HTML, and CSS files in a public GitHub repository. Each time you commit and push an update to the repository, the [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com/) service creates static HTML pages based on these files, which are hosted on GitHub's servers free of charge.
