Hi! Iâ€™m a Ph.D. student majoring in computer science in the [School of Computer Science and Engineering](https://www2.scut.edu.cn/cs/) at [South China University of Technology](https://www.scut.edu.cn/new/). I am fortunately advised by Prof. Lu Lu. 

My research interests include inference acceleration for large language models (LLMs), GEMM optimization, and parallel computing acceleration techniques for AI. I focus on improving computational efficiency and scalability through hardware-aware optimization and parallel processing.
